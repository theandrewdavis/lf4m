Web dashboard to help World of Warcraft raid leaders form pick-up groups. When you get a torrent of whispers, add the names to the dashboard to compare the ilvl and progression of your candidate raid members.

### Why? ###
When I was in charge of forming pick-up group raids, I found it difficult to keep track of everyone who whispered me and annoying to get the stats I cared about: spec, ilvl, and progression history. This dashboard uses [jquery-jsonp](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/), [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and the [WoW Community API](http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/) to make that process a little less painful.

### Obsolete ###
My time as a raid leader has come to an end, and so too has this app -- it is no longer hosted.
