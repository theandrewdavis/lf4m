Web dashboard to help World of Warcraft raid leaders form pick-up groups. When you get a torrent of whispers, add the names to the dashboard to compare the ilvl and progression of your candidate raid members.

### Why? ###
When I was in charge of forming pick-up group raids, I found it difficult to keep track of everyone who whispered me and annoying to get the stats I cared about: spec, ilvl, and progression history. This dashboard uses [jquery-jsonp](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/), [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and the [WoW Community API](http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/) to make that process a little less painful.

### Usage ###
The page is hosted here on my public Dropbox - [check it out](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3071966/lf4m/index.html). If you want to check it out but don't know any current character names, you can look at the [PvP leaderboards](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/pvp/arena/ruin/2v2) to find some names, but make sure you have the right realm selected.
